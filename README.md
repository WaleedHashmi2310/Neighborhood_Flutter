# Neighborhood
## A serverless Flutter and Firebase application.
A platform for residential area management and a hyperlocal social networking service for members of the area.

This project serves to:

Provide a crowd sourced, collaborative social/informational hub for local neighborhoods.

Enable the management/security offices of residential schemes to become aware of the issues their community faces, manage the neighborhood better and have faster access to information related to crime and illegal activities.

Enable local businesses and service providers to better understand their target audience and market themselves efficiently

The platform will provide residential communities with a platform that brings them together, makes their social interaction easier, helps them voice their concerns and opinions, help businesses understand them better and come together to build safer, more closely-knit neighborhoods.
